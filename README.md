Website design built for an educational institute.

=============

This repository contains the web design concept I am realising for my school website.
Everything in here is exclusively illustrative and does not resemble the final website, that it would be finished up with its contents.
To everyone who wants to take this an example for his own concept, is completely able to do it without restrictions.
To everyone who wants to take this as template for his own website or whatever, is asked to add the original creator to the final website.
